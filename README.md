A network packet sniffer is a tool used to capture and analyze network traffic. Here's an overview based on the image you provided:

Scapy Installation and Import:

Scapy is a powerful Python library used for network packet manipulation. The output shows that Scapy is already installed in your environment.
Packet Sniffer Script:

The script packet_sniffer.py is executed to capture network packets on a specified interface, in this case, eth0.
The script seems to be printing information such as source IP, destination IP, and the protocol type (e.g., UDP).
Network Interface Details:

ifconfig command output is shown, providing details about the network interfaces (eth0 and lo).
eth0 has an IP address of 10.0.2.15 and lo (loopback) has an IP address of 127.0.0.1.
Captured Packet Information:

Multiple packets are captured and displayed.
Each captured packet displays:
Source IP: The IP address from which the packet originated.
Destination IP: The IP address to which the packet is destined.
Protocol: The type of protocol used (UDP in this case).
Payload Data: The actual data contained in the packet.
Analysis:

This type of packet sniffer can be used to monitor network traffic for various purposes, including troubleshooting network issues, analyzing network performance, and detecting malicious activities.
